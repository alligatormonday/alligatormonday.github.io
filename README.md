# Responsive_Portfolio_Assignment

## Description

Submission for my second assignment within the Full-Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp via University of Arizona. 

In this assignment, I was tasked with creating a portfolio site using Bootstrap.

My goals were as follows:
* Develop a portfolio site with...
    * A Navbar (on every page)
    * A responsive layout
    * Responsive Images
* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, columns)
* Use semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure
* Properly use Bootstrap components and grid system
* Valid and correct HTML (use verification service) 

I approached this assignment knowing that I wanted to challenge myself. I feel fairly comfortable using Bootstrap and I feel that I've demonstrated a beginners comprehension of this framework. 

I used a Bootswatch theme to give my site a different look that the 'out of the box' Bootstrap code. I modeled my pages off of the given examples provided by my instructor, and took some creative licensing/influence from other website and examples I found in my search for portfolio sites. 

This was a fairly challenging assignment for me. It was important to me to color outside of the lines, a little bit, in order to have an understanding of the limitations within Bootstrap.
