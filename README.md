# Responsive_Portfolio_Assignment

## Author: alligatormonday (Joseph Jepson)

## Description

Submission for my second assignment within the Full-Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp via University of Arizona. 

In this assignment, I was tasked with creating a responsive portfolio site using Bootstrap.

My goals were as follows:
* Develop a portfolio site with...
    * A Navbar (on every page)
    * A responsive layout
    * Responsive Images
* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, columns)
* Use semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure
* Properly use Bootstrap components and grid system
* Valid and correct HTML (use verification service) 

I approached this assignment knowing that I wanted to challenge myself. I now feel fairly comfortable using Bootstrap after completing this assignment. I think that I've demonstrated a _beginners_ comprehension of this framework. 

I used a custom Bootswatch theme (see below for credit/source) to give my site a slightly different look than the _out of the box_ Bootstrap code. I modeled my pages off of the given examples provided by my instructor, and took some creative licensing/influence from other website and examples I found in my search for portfolio sites. 

This was a fairly challenging assignment for me. It was important to me to color outside of the lines, a little bit, in order to have an understanding of the limitations within Bootstrap. I spent too much time on trying to add fancy things though, like the footer. I wasn't able to quite figure out how to make the footer _sticky_. I am happy with the footer though. I watched some YouTube videos and modeled my footer off of a famous photographer's website. Sourced below. It was a fun way to add to my page and make it stand out. It also has added benefit of bringing a more _professional_ quality to the site. I felt really excited and proud when I was able to get it work and respond functionally. 

Overall, I spent too much time on this assignment. My instructor provided some good insight, that I plan to stick to over the duration of this course. Going forward, I will spend no more than 10 hours on a given assignment. I notice that I get very stuck on the aesthetics and the design of things. Sometimes to my own detriment. After putting in enough time (whether the assignment is complete or not), I will submit the assignment. Then after I have sufficiently studied the current week's materials, and if I have the time to do so, I will go back and try to implement other features to my previous assignments. 

I loved this assignment, it helped solidify some concepts that I was coming across in the first assignment, where we refactored code. Specifically, the navbar. That was a huge headache in that assignment. Using the components and grid system within flex made laying things out much simpler.
